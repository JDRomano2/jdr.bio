The Romano Lab at the University of Pennsylvania uses informatics and data science to answer "big picture" questions about environmental health. We develop public biomedical knowledge graphs and analyze them to both predict and explain the clinical outcomes that result from exposures to specific chemicals. Methodologically, we have made important contributions to the fields of graph machine learning, automated machine learning, semantic data analysis, and integrative multi-omics. Our research has led to new discoveries in therapeutic effects of venom-derived peptides and new associations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and liver diseases. We are involved in the ongoing development of the Alzheimer's Knowledge Base, a major new resource for drug discovery in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
