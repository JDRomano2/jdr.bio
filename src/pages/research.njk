        My research mainly focuses on translational bioinformatics, with methodological contributions in artificial intelligence (especially graph machine learning and automated machine learning), and applications in computational toxicology and systems pharmacology. This page lists some of the major research projects I'm involved in.

      <div class="project">
        <h4><a href="http://comptox.ai" target="_blank">ComptoxAI</a></h4>
        <p>
          A toolchain for artificial intelligence applications in computational toxicology. ComptoxAI provides a number of interconnected components, including a large heterogeneous graph database of toxicology concepts, an OWL ontology for computational toxicology, a gallery of graph machine learning models, and informational/educational resources.

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/JDRomano2/tpot/tree/nn">TPOT-NN</a></h4>
        <p>
          An extension to <a href="https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/">TPOT</a> (a Python tool for optimizing machine learning pipelines using genetic programming) that adds support for PyTorch neural network models. We're currently developing support for diverse data types, including imaging data and sequence data (free text, time series, etc.). Our goal is to introduce neural networks in the context of automated machine learning without losing the model introspection advantages that come with AutoML run on non-neural network algorithms.

      <div class="project">
        <h4><a href="http://venomkb.org" target="_blank">VenomKB</a></h4>
        <p>
          A knowledge base and collection of related tools for computational venom research, particularly for the purpose of discovering new therapeutic effects of venom-derived peptides.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h4><a href="https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CU-VO" target="_blank">Venom Ontology</a></h4>
        <p>
          An OWL ontology used to structure and perform automated reasoning on VenomKB, enabling advanced computational queries of venom data and discovery of previously unknown therapeutic associations between venoms and human diseases.
