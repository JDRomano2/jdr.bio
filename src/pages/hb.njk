      It's a bit hard to find decent greeting cards right now (given recent
      events), so rather than breaking out the construction paper and colored
      pencils, I thought I'd make something for you that's a bit more
      compatible with my natural skill set.

      Can you believe this is the 5th time we've celebrated your birthday
      together?
    </p>

    <p>
      All of my love goes to you, Sarah. I'd follow you to the moon and back,
      and wouldn't regret a moment of it.
    </p>
