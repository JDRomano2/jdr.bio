      <h2>Joseph D. Romano, PhD</h2>
      <h3>Biomedical data scientist and translational bioinformatician</h3>

      <hr>

      <p>
        I'm currently a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, where I work in the research group of Jason Moore. Recently, I earned my PhD from Columbia University, where I was a member of the Tatonetti Lab. I specialize in translational bioinformatics, computational toxinology, and environmental toxicology.

        For more information about my research, publications, or CV/résumé, please see the links at the top of the page.

            <b>Translational Bioinformatics</b> is the field of study that uses computational techniques to link molecular entities (proteins, genes, drugs) to clinical entities (humans, body systems, diagnoses).
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Computational toxinology</b> (not 'toxicology') is the use of computers to discover new characteristics from venoms and the molecules that comprise venoms, especially for the purpose of discovering new drugs.
